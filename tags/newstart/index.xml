      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start posting tutorials on how to make a hugo theme quite soon, as I myself made this site using Hugo, and boy would it have been a treat to find out all I did during the process &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I started it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About me then, I&amp;rsquo;m a eighteen year old obsessed with computers, currently pursuing a degree in CS (go figures) from the University of Calcutta. Love music and programming. Hate programming at the same time. Ameteur designer and enthusiastic about making stuff look not bad. This blog will be sort of a (well-written) notebook about all the things I think are interesting, and rants about stuff that is not. I hope you strap along for the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Oh, and updates wheneverly, for now at least)&lt;/p&gt;
